### My name is applesfruit (or you can call me fruits) and I use many programming languages ranging from Python to C++.

I normally use Java, C#, and NodeJS/TS, but I use many others for multiple projects.

I am currently working on:
 - AlphaLands KitPvP (https://alphalands.net)
 - Secret (gonna release soon)
 - Arctic Studios
 - Maybe more? Trying to find ideas.
