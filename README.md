### My name is applesfruit (or you can call me fruits) and I use many programming languages ranging from Python to C++.

I normally use Java, C#, and C++, but I use many others for multiple projects.

I am currently working on:
 - ReflexHosting (https://reflexhosting.net)
 - EZStats
 - Arctic Development
 - Maybe more? Trying hard to find ideas.

I am currently doing commissions! Contact me on Discord for more information.
